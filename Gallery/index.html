                <p>
                    RESUSCITATING OUR DYING HERITAGE 
                    India, a melting pot of cultures was once called “Sone Ki Chidiya” owing to its 
                    prosperous trade and socio-economic systems. Unfortunately, due to changing 
                    times many of such trades and practices have become defunct. Ranging from 
                    intricate art forms to simple textile weaving, these businesses are teetering on 
                    the brink of extinction. As citizens of this rich land it is our duty to revive what 
                    is a rather important part of our heritage and culture. 
                    With a view of reviving, Sthaapna presents its “LOST INDIAN BUSINESSES AND 
                    THEIR REVIVAL” conclave, drawing attention to the various obsolete 
                    professions that have now lost their glory and are fighting for survival.
                    Being held on 26th January, this research conclave calls for young students to 
                    present research papers on Indian businesses that have become inert and 
                    have lost their significance. It is our rich heritage and a treasure which has 
                    been protected for us by our ancestors. We ought to take pride in its meaning 
                    and importance.

                <h1>Think for India - Second conclave</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Our nation having more than 50% of its population below the age of 25, and 
                    more than 65% of population below the age of 35, is a hub of youth power. If 
                    we channelize this energy with the right approach then India can reach the 
                    pinnacle and become a world leader.
                    With this vision, Sthaapna is working on its third vertical “Think For India”.
                    ‘Sthaapna- Think for India’ provides a forum to the unheard voices to share 
                    their imagination and turn it into reality. With innovative ideas coming from 
                    young minds, we can nurture them and build a community of entrepreneurs 
                    who will take this nation forward through development, growth and welfare.
                    To make the concept of self-reliance achievable, it is important to take the ideas 
                    of youth into consideration. Sthaapna aims to spark young minds and provide 
                    a forum for their creative ideas and initiatives. 
                    The stage where people can use their innovation and knowledge to create ideas 
                    which will not only bring them profit but will also help build a better India. 
                    This platform will also motivate, appreciate and guide budding entrepreneurs

                <h1>Reviving the lost philosophy of Great Indian Sages</h1>
                <p>
                    For a long period of time, our country, India was under the influence of foreign 
                    invaders. A handful of marauders decided what we Indians would learn of our 
                    past. There was a time when this holy land treasured scholarly gems like Adi 
                    Shankaracharya, who gave the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta; Kabir Das, 
                    whose writings inspired the Bhakti Movement; and Guru Samarth Ramdas, who 
                    inspired valorous kings like Chhatrapati Shivaji. When Thomas Babington 
                    Macaulay commented that a single shelf of a good European library was worth 
                    the whole native literature of India and Arabia, it was an attempt to erode the 
                    legacy of our rich literature and substantial knowledge. An attempt to never let 
                    the aboriginal people take pride in their literature, to never let the discoveries 
                    and philosophies be recognized with the originators. 
                    Despite the efforts to mock and defame the sublime lives of the great Indian 
                    Saints, their unparalleled philosophy could not be entirely eliminated. In the 
                    contemporary world, it has been accepted that the Indus Valley Civilization was 
                    a prosperous and highly developed civilization. The Indian subcontinent had 
                    witnessed the progenitors of wisdom, enlightening the human race with the 
                    wisdom of Vedas. While the earliest of the civilizations were still learning to 
                    question the human existence, the great Indian seers had already discovered 
                    the laws that govern the emergence and evolution of universe. The sages and 
                    seers not only gave spiritual insights but they also established a strong tradition 
                    of science and technology with some ground-breaking discoveries and 
                    innovation.
