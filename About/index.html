                Sthaapna is trying to ignite young minds and give a platform to their innovative ideas and initiatives through community building and a model of entrepreneurship. To make the concept of self-reliance achievable, it is important to take the ideas of youth into consideration.
                Sthaapna tries to help the youth find their purpose of life and guide them in their ventures so that they can lead a purposeful life and also contribute in nation-building.
                Following the approach of nationalism and welfare, we are striving to create a society which has active participation of the youth. In order to achieve this, we need to channelize their energy in the right direction and give them the knowledge and guidance which can help them take the right decisions in life. Our two verticals stand strong on this vision and spread these fundamentals.

            <p class="info">
                Sthaapna is tirelessly working towards empowering the Indian youth, who, in the future, can help in the nation-building process. 
                Standing on the principles of nationalism and welfare, the organization has a vision of bringing the country together with logic, reasoning, and true nationalism.

            <p class="info">
                The organization is giving a platform to young minds to imagine, ignite, and invent.
                We aim to channelize the youth energy in the right direction and make them aware of the glorious Indian history which is unknown even today.

                For the longest time, India has been a market of cheap labor. 
                We have provided the world with the best of minds and ideas at a penny price. 
                
                
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                
                The reason why the world’s largest democracy, whose maximum population is youth, 
                is a mere market for labour is that we lack opportunities within the national boundaries. 
                Sthaapna dreams of changing this scenario and making India the most prominent recruiter of great minds.

                    The Indian History has always been written with contempt which we have learnt to feel for our past, 
                    and with the lack of understanding we developed for our culture during the days of foreign domination. 
                    In order to make people aware about our glorious past and inculcate in them nationalistic sentiments for our nation, 
                    Sthaapna organizes quizzes on important aspects of Indian history which remain unhighlighted

                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    Through this vertical, we spread awareness about our glorious history, 
                    Indian culture and philosophy which is the essence of this soil. 
                    It is our rich heritage and a treasure which our ancestors have preserved for us. 
                    We need to realize its significance and value, and take pride in it. Thus, through a wide range of contests, 
                    Sthaapna is trying to engage the youth and make them aware about Indian warriors, eminent leaders, and unsung heroes, 
                    and enhance in them self-esteem about their own nation.

                    Our nation, having more than 65% of the population below the age of 35, is a hub of youth power. 
                    If we channelize this energy with the right approach then India can reach the pinnacle and become a world leader. 
                    With this vision, Sthaapna is working on its vertical “Think For India”.

                    ‘Sthaapna- Think for India’ gives a platform to the unheard voices to share their imagination and turn it into reality. 
                    With innovative ideas coming from young minds, we can nurture them and build a community of entrepreneurs who will take this nation 
                    forward through development, growth and welfare.
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    
                    It’s a stage where people can use their innovation and knowledge to create ideas which will not only bring 
                    them profit but will also help build a better India. This platform aims to motivate, appreciate and guide budding entrepreneurs.
