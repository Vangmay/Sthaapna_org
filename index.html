                    SHARMISHTHA SINGH RANAWAT:
                    I am Sharmishtha Singh Ranawat, a third year student of St. Stephen's College, Delhi. I am deeply fond of Indian philosophy, 
                    culture and civilizational history. My experience at Sthaapnaâ€™s Research conclave was enthralling. 
                    The theme of the conclave was unique and very relevant in the current times. It is also an unexplored chapter of India's glorious 
                    history which does not find a place in our syllabi. 
                    While researching for the conclave, I learnt about some very interesting bits of India's trade and cultural exchanges as well as our 
                    historical soft power. There is a lot we can learn from history and work on reviving our past glory to make our lives better. 
                    The papers presented by all participants were deeply insightful and were a learning experience. I congratulate Sthaapna for their wonderful 
                    initiative which will go a long way in Bharat's larger journey of Atmanirbharta.
                </p>

                    FARSHID DARUWALLA :
                    Our country has a lot of potential which when tapped correctly can produce fabulous results. As history has it, India has been able to enthrall anyone who sets eyes on her. It is quite the privilege to be part of such a vibrant and a distinct country. Amidst modernization and technological advancements, we the youth of the country have forgotten our roots and our rich heritage. Keeping this in mind Sthaapna organized a research conclave where the focus was: Lost Indian Businesses. Surprisingly the conclave turned into a melting pot of various intricate art techniques and forms which indeed were quite intriguing. From gara embroidery, patola sarees and architecture to trade relations between India and China. Sthaapna played quite a role in making the youth understand what they have been missing out on all this while. 
                    When it comes to me, I chose the Gara Embroidery which is highly intricate and delicate and has a beauty of its own. One interprets it differently every single time as each piece has a different story to tell. This research conclave not only made me dig deeper into our country's art forms but also made me connect with my own heritage. Going through different gara pieces of my own family to understanding how one is actually made, this research has definitely taught me more than I expected.
                    Lastly, Sthaapna has presented a fabulous conclave where they successfully completed their goal of making today's youth realize how vibrant and beautiful our past is.

                   <span class="bold"> Tanisha Acharya :</span>
                    "A brave, frank, clean-hearted, courageous and aspiring youth is the only foundation on which the future nation can be built"  These words of Swami Vivekananda are being brought into action by Sthaapna. 
                    Being a part of the Research Conclave organized by Sthaapna has been an experience which is one of a kind. For an aspiring young student like me this has been an enlightening session and has ignited in us the spirit to contribute actively in the resurgence of the rich cultural heritage of India. The deliberation over the need of reviving the lost Indian businesses has paved the way for us, to bring in innovative methods and renew the entrepreneurship skills for the betterment of the society. 
                    As a budding blogger and an enthusiastic debater this has been a wonderful opportunity for me  to learn and express new ideas. It has dawned upon me a new way of thinking and analyzing issues of importance. It has been a privilege to be a part of this event.
